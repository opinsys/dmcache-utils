Device mapper cache utilities
=============================

License: GPLv2+, see COPYING for details

This project provides few simple scripts to simplify the usage of
dmcache devices. These scripts are based on the work of Darrick
J. Wong [1]. They have been rewritten and simplified to better fit our
needs. I was also scared of getting my BIOS reflashed with rude
poetry.

dmc-load
--------

Load and activate dmcache devices defined in /etc/dmctab.

Usage: dmc-load [NAME]

NAME - a name of the device mapper cache device defined in
       /etc/dmctab. If not given, load all dmctab entries.

dmc-mklvm
---------

Format a disk with LVM partitions suitable for dmcache devices.

Usage: dmc-mklvm [-b CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE=512] VG PV

CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE - the size of cache blocks. This is used to calculate
                   the optimal size for the metadata device. Default
                   is 512 sectors.

VG - name for the volume group

PV - physical volume for the volume group, e.g. a disk, a disk
     partition, etc.
